In [a previous article](/frontend/svg-basics), we saw how to write a basic svg. Let's now see how to fill it with basic shapes!

## Nice-to-know things about svg elements

By default, all elements are filled with black.

If you want to change that, you can set the `fill` property to a color name like `red`, an hex color like `#ff0000`, a CSS function like `rgb(255 0 0)` or to `none`.

You can also draw a stroke with `stroke` (for the color) and `stroke-width`.

You can group several basic shapes with the `<g>` element.

## SVG shapes

### circle

It is defined by its center position with `cx` and `cy`, then its radius with `r`.

```
<svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="-100 -100 200 200">
  <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="20" fill="orange" />
</svg>
```

<svg
  width="200"
  height="200"
  viewBox="-100 -100 200 200"
  style="background-color: white"
>
  <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="20" fill="orange" />
</svg>

### rect

It is defined with `x` and `y` for the position of the top-left corner, then `width` and `height`.

`rx` will make the edges of the rectangle rounded (similar to `border-radius` for HTML elements)
`ry` can be set to set a different radius on the Y axis. If not set, it falls back to the previous one.

### polygon

It has a `points` property that sets a list of coordinates that are connected with straight lines.

### line

It is drawn from `x1`/`y1` to `x2`/`y2`.

`stroke-linecap: round` can make the line caps rounded.

### polyline

The difference with a polygon is that a polygon closes itself, while a polyline stays open.

### path

It can define pretty much everything.

The shape is defined by the `d` attribute that lists drawing commands.
A command always starts with a letter defining its type, and ends with a coordinate. A command alwats continues the previous command.

`M` = `move-to`, moves the cursor to a point without drawing a line
`L` = `line-to`, draws a straight line from the previous point
`Z` closes the path by drawing a straight line from the current point to the starting point

Example: draw a burger icon

```
<svg
  width="200"
  height="200"
  viewBox="-100 -100 200 200"
  style="background-color: white"
>
  <path
    d="
        M -45 -45
        L  45 -45
        M -45   0
        L  45   0
        M -45  45
        L  45  45"
    stroke="#333333"
    stroke-width="15"
    stroke-linecap="round"
  />
</svg>
```

<svg
  width="200"
  height="200"
  viewBox="-100 -100 200 200"
  style="background-color: white"
>
  <path
    d="
        M -45 -45
        L  45 -45
        M -45   0
        L  45   0
        M -45  45
        L  45  45"
    stroke="#333333"
    stroke-width="15"
    stroke-linecap="round"
  />
</svg>

You can also draw curves with the `path` element.

#### Quadratic curves

The quadratic Bezier curve needs a control point apart from the endpoint: it is an invisible coordinate to which the line is bending.
To draw a quadratic curve, use the `Q` command: it indicates the control point, then the endpoint like this: `Q xControlPoint yControlPoint xEnd yEnd`.

See this link for more detail and examples: https://svg-tutorial.com/svg/quadratic-bezier.

#### Cubic curves

Cubic Bezier curves have 2 control points: one that defines the curve's initial direction, and one that sets how the curve should reach its endpoint.
Use the `C` command to draw a cubic curve like this: `C x1ControlPoint y1ControlPoint x2ControlPoint y2ControlPoint xEnd yEnd`

See this link for more detail and examples: https://svg-tutorial.com/svg/cubic-bezier.

### ellipse

`ellipse` behaves like a circle, except it has 2 radiuses: a horizontal one `rx` and a vertical one `ry`.
